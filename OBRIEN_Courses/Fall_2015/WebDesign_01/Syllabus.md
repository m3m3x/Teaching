#Web Design 01
Instructor: Nicholas O’Brien
Contact: nobrien@stevens.edu

####Course Description
This class is structured to give students the foundations of designing and programing creative works that will primarily be viewed in the browser. During the semester students will discover ways to translate (or enhance) their creative practices/energies with HTML, CSS, jQuery, and 3js. Though “design” is in the title of the course, students should expect to create works of art by the end of the semester. Skills gained in this class can be applied toward a variety of commercial purposes: user experience (UX) design, front-end development, and creative programming. However, within the classroom we will primarily focus on making critically engaging works of art. With this focus in mind, students should expect to be challenged to think critically about the way they participate in online communities and social media. Engagement with–and reflection on–the way web design effects our behavior is central to understanding how your work can impact others online. Through research and collaborative problem solving, students will create work that speaks to the social conditions of our time while critically engaging how the web has shaped contemporary culture.

TL;DR we’re making netart in this class.

####Class Structure
Classes will primarily involve group discussions, looking at artworks, and critiques of student projects. Though technical tutorials will occur during the beginning of the semester, this course is primary structured to serve as a research-based studio course. The instructor will be more than happy to provide technical feedback and coding tutorials, but students should be expected to utilize independent research time to develop skills necessary for technically executing their projects. This will differ for each student and will be addressed on an individual basis during critiques or individual meetings.

Daily class schedule will be broken down into two blocks of “activities.” The first block will be mostly group workshops: demos, reading discussions, or looking at artwork. The second block will be more independent: work days, research time, structure surfing sessions, or individual meetings. All classes will try to follow this template as rigorously as possible, but flexibility and student initiative can alter this formula. The two exceptions for this will be when we take (potential) field trips or when we have class critiques (both of which will require the entire class period).

####Attendance
The Visual Art & Technology policy for classes is that attendance is mandatory. The success of this class hinges on student participation and engagement. If you are not here for demos, class critiques, group discussions, and collaborative activities, then we all suffer.

You are allowed two absences. After the third absence your final grade will be automatically lowered by one letter. If you are >10 minuets late you will be marked tardy and three tardies equal an absence. As will be noted later, class participation is part of your grade. This means even if you are here, you must be present. Coming to class unprepared or wasting class time could result in being marked absent.

The only exception to this policy is in the case of extreme illness/injury. Please talk with the professor privately about any concerns you have about this policy.

####Grading
* Class Participation: 25%			
* Quizzes: 15%
* Micro-Assignments: 25%	
* Midterm and Final Project: 35%

Grading for assignments and projects will be based on a combination of criteria:

* Aesthetic Consistency
* Technical Execution
* Creative Interpretation/Imagination
* Risk
* Intellectual Rigor

These criteria are not weighted for specific preference/importance. With this in mind, students should consider the choices they make in designing and executing their work. Furthermore, students can expect that the above criteria will be applied in critiques as a starting point for discussion and evaluation.

####Cellphone Policy
Cell phones are forbidden in class. At the beginning of class, students will be asked to switch off their phones to prevent texting, checking social media, and distracting yourself or others. This policy is enforced to insure class participation and also to collectively agree we are committed to respecting one another.

####A Note on Copyright
We will be discussing copyright and its implications on our culture over the course of the semester. For the purposes of this class, however, you must consider the copyright of your work and the work of others. It will be a requirement in this class to release/distribute your work using Creative Commons licenses, and understanding how Intellectual Property laws manifest online will become beneficial in your creative and professional careers.

This being said, all work produced in the class must be of your own creation. Any assignments submitted during the semester that uses appropriated imagery, code, music, text, or other forms of intellectual property must be properly cited and articulated to the professor. Failure to do so will be considered plagiarism, which will result in immediate academic reprimanding or reporting to the honor board.

As noted, conversations regarding copyright and sharing of content via online distribution will be a constant topic throughout the course but please pay attention to the above warnings.

####Required Materials
Unlike other media, web design is relatively cheap to produce and maintain. This being said, the following materials are required for this course. Again, not having proper materials for class will reflect on your class participation and attendance.

* Pen + Paper for taking notes
* USB Hard Drive / Flash Drive (64GB+)
* Cloud Storage Space (Dropbox, Google Drive, personal server)
* Blog / Personal Webspace for posting work updates and journaling
* PATH / MTA metrocard for fieldtrips / site visits

####Required Reading
All reading materials for this course will be provided by the professor or available online in PDF/ebook formats. With the exception of content already distributed for free online, it is requested that you limit the circulation of printed material to personal use. The professor encourages you to support the authors of the text whenever possible. Additional readings will be recommended on an individual basis with regards to specific research.

####Assignments / Quizzes
Course assignments will be broken down into two categories: micro-assignments and projects. 

Micro-assignments will be discussed in class and will primarily concern technical demonstrations that evidence an understanding of class material. These might also involve reading responses and other “light homework” for you to complete between two class meetings. These assignments are not intended to be busy work, but instead are encouraging students to develop their technical and intellectual skills outside of the classroom.

Projects are longer-term works that will be developed over the course of the semester. Two primary projects will be assigned during the semester: the midterm and the final. Project prompts will be issued in timely ways as the semester progresses. Prompts will depend on class development and ability to progress through lesson plans.

All assignments will be due MONDAY BEFORE MIDNIGHT and should be turned in electronically to the professor in an appropriate manner.

--

Quizzes will be given four times during the semester to make sure that students are retaining technical material. These will be 20 minuet timed multiple choice and short answer quizzes. Preparedness for these quizzes will not require additional outside of class study as long as students are taking diligent notes, completing micro-assignments, and doing the reading. No laptops, cellphones, or electronic devices connected to the Internet will be allowed. You are allowed to reference hand-written notes, but they must be present before quizzes are issued.
