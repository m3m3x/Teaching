# TEACHING REPO INVITATION/INVOCATION

This public repository is made to document, track changes, and open up the pedagogical practices.

In an effort to apply open source methodologies towards academic research and course development, <a href="http://doubleunderscore.net">Nicholas O'Brien</a> invites you to submit, change, alter, and contribute to this repository in a helpful, constructive, and respectful manner.

This document should serve as a location for contributors (or individuals benefitting from the collective intellectual property stored herein) to voice radical perspectives on the current state of art education and digital media scholarship.

Far from a manifesto, this document should read a list of potential solutions for advancing the betterment of decentralized academic research and alternative pedagogical practices.

In doing so, I ask that any potential contributors and/or participants to be mindful of one another. One reason why I have chosen version control software to track this process/research is to ensure that no content will be systematically deleted. Therefore, participants are encouraged to not only abstain from deleting content that is not theirs, but to be mindful of their own personal contributions.

Invitation to participate in this repo is open. 
Please direct any questions / concerns with this repo to nicholasobri AT gmail DOT com.
